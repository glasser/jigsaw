Things that 'hq' had that weren't done in Jigsaw for 2013:

- related queries on puzzle pages (ie, metas)
- custom css to make puzzle search pages more pretty

That said, some rethinking for next year:

- Typically, # of spreadsheets == 1.  It's not a problem to create them and
  leave unused, and they can have multiple sheets. Should change to just give
  every puzzle one SS, and optimize the display around a iframe pseudo-embedded
  sheet with a little bit of puzzle on top.

- Hard-code a little more of the metadata. eg, we can assume that there is
  something called a "round", but just that puzzles can have multiple
  rounds. eg, a left sidebar showing all unsolved puzzles, sorted by round,
  would do much of what we currently get from searches.  it would also be OK if
  we hardcoded the existence of 'status' a little more.  then we could have
  puzzle pages that are mostly spreadsheets, and round pages that are mostly
  searches.
